	      			<p class="w3-large">We first met on November 6, 2014 (yes, it was so memorable, we know the exact date). We met at a weekly Happy Hour imposed by Alessandra Graber and Nick Heckelman at Sybergs. Over the span of 4 months, we got to know each other, became friends, and shamelessly flirted with one another.</p>
	      			<p class="w3-large">We *finally* had our first official date on Sunday, March 8, 2015 , which went so well, Nathan allowed me to invite him on a very uncomfortable second date. On this date, we were both very out of our element at a St. Patrick's Day celebration with Brittany and Sean Schuchman. Sean, not realizing it was our second date, asked if Nathan was my boyfriend. This sparked a very early conversation of what we both wanted out of our relationship and I have been making Nathan's life difficult ever since.</p>
	      			<p class="w3-large">When he proposed on July 2, 2017, we were out hiking preparing for an upcoming vacation to Oregon and Nathan had the whole thing planned. The only problem was I wouldn't sit down! I refused and told him "Jonathan [Graber] won't let us sit down in Oregon, so we can't now. Besides, we're almost done." to which he replied "I know, and you're making it difficult for me to propose to you." After this, Nathan pulled out two items from his backpack: a ring box and a Marauder's Map. The box had the following note folded up inside:</p>
	      			<p class="w3-large">"On the journey of life, it is hard to determine where you are going to end up. It is easy to get lost down any path or take the wrong turn at any corner. I know you have had a hard time figuring out which path to take when you are giving me directions. To help you on this journey, I bought you a map. I know it isn't the best map because it is of a fictional world, but isn't that the perfect map for us? Our love is reight out of a fantasy world and a fictional map of a fictional world sounds like the perfect way to lead us down our journey of love and life together.</p>
